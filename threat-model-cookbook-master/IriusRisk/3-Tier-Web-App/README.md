## Contents
### What are we building?
- See the Dataflow Diagram.png
- The first few pages of the Threat Model and Risk Report PDF file contain the answers to questions that define how the individual components behave and are configured.

### What can go wrong?
- See the Table of Threats
- The last section of the PDF report contains a table of threats, the planned mitigation and the status of the countermeasure progress

### What are we going to do about it?
- The last section of the PDF report contains a table that describes how each of the threats are going to be mitigated (if at all).  
- In the same PDF report, the "Risks Accepted" table describes risks that are not going to be mitigated.

### Did we do a good job?
- This is not answered by an output from this threat modeling tool.
